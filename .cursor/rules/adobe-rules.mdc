# Adobe Spectrum Web Components Project Rules

## Commit Messages
- All commit messages must follow the Conventional Commits format (e.g., feat: add new feature, fix: resolve bug).
- Breaking changes must be clearly indicated and discussed before merging.

## GitHub Integration
- Ensure the Cursor GitHub app is installed and configured with write access for all contributors.
- All contributors must have appropriate GitHub permissions (at least write access) to the repository.
- Do not use placeholder values (e.g., "YOUR-USERNAME") in configuration files or scripts; always replace with actual values.

## Code Quality
- All code must pass linting and type checks before merging.
- All new features and bug fixes must include relevant tests.
- Avoid code duplication; refactor shared logic into reusable modules or components.
- Use TypeScript for all source files; avoid using `any` unless necessary and justified.

## Documentation
- Update documentation for any user-facing changes.
- Remove unused or deprecated components, features, or documentation promptly.

## Accessibility
- All UI components must meet accessibility standards (WCAG 2.1 AA or higher).

## Dependency Management
- Use Yarn for dependency management; do not use npm.
- Keep dependencies up to date and remove unused packages regularly.

## Generated Files
- Do not commit generated files (e.g., build artifacts, lock files other than yarn.lock) to the repository.

## Storybook & Documentation
- After making changes to documentation or Storybook configuration, restart the relevant server unless otherwise specified.

## Naming & Structure
- Use clear, descriptive names for files, components, and variables.
- Organize code logically by feature or domain.

## Polyfills
- Do not add polyfills for unsupported browsers; target only modern browsers as per project requirements.
